# involves extracting governing equations of physical systems from noisy experimental data following https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.151738411; Discovering governing equations from data by sparse identification of nonlinear dynamical systems; Steven L. Bruntona,1, Joshua L. Proctorb, and J. Nathan Kutzc. 


the dynamics of a chaotic lorenz system has been derived from the generated data at varied noise amplitudes. An FFT based thresholding approach has been used to denoise the derivative, other possible methods include variation regularization and singular value optimal thresholding.
